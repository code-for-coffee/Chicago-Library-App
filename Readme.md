#SinatraBackboneBoilerplate

Hi there! This is a simple Sinatra boilerplate that includes *jQuery*, *underscore.js*, and *Backbone.js*. The **bower** package manager is used to maintain these Javascript libraries.

This boilerplate contains just a root route to get you started with your next Sinatra application. It also contains two erb views - a *header* view (contains relative links to CSS and Javascript files) and an index view that includes the header as a partial.

A blank app.js and main.css file have been included as well.

To get started, run:
```bash
bundle
bundle exec rackup
```
